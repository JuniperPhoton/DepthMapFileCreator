This app enables you to merge an image with a grayscale depth map into a single file that retains depth map data.

The output file can be accessed by certain apps such as Photos or Adobe Camera RAW.

The depth map image can be generated by some online tools or you can manually draw by yourself using Photoshop or other tools.
